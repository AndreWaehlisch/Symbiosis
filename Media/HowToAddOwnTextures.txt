1. Create a texture file. This file must be in a format WoW recognizes, e.g. ".tga". Width and height of the image must be of power of 2.

2. Name your texture file something distinctive, like "MyAwesomeArt1".

3. Copy your texture file to: "WoW\Interface\AddOns\Symbiosis\Media\MyMediaAddon\".

4. Open the file "MyMediaAddon.lua" (in the same folder) with a text editor (Notepad++ is a good one).

5. In the 1st line you will see "local FileNames" and a list of names. Add your "MyAwesomeArt1" there (or whatever it is called, also you can remove the dummy names). You must seperate your file names with a comma and all names must be in "quotation marks"! You don't have to add the file extension.

6. Copy the whole "MyMediaAddon" to your "WoW\Interface\AddOns\" directory.

7. Restart WoW.

(You can also use the addon SharedMedia. It has a HOWTO and a simple batch file for your needs.)
